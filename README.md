# BTree-and-Variants
## Implementation of building and searching B and B+ Trees of variable depth d in C++

## Bd tree:
A B-tree or Bd-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structre that maintains sorted data and allows searches, allows sequential access, insertions and deletions in logarithmic time. 
This tree generalizes the Binary Search Tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. It is commonly used in databases and file systems as it is well suited for storage systems that read and write large blocks of data.
